                I promise that these projects will become increasingly complex over time, as 
                I continue to challenge myself and push my skills to 
                new heights. I'm excited to share my progress with you and hope that these projects will inspire others to
                start their own coding adventures.</p>

<h1 class="backgtoundheader">  About me  </h1>

<p class="backgroundinfo"> I am that rare case, or maybe not, where I got into tech from a completely different field. After studying 
    at Tbilisi State University for six years, I realized that medicine was not my passion. While I loved the science and 
    theory behind it, practicing medicine wasn't for me. I had to choose between continuing to do 
    something that didn't fulfill me or pursuing something that did. At the age of 25, I decided to take the leap and pursue programming, 
    which had always interested me. I love the process of creation, and programming is all about creation.
     Despite my medical studies, I had always been watching YouTube channels and doing programming tutorials on the side. I started with frontend development, as it is 
     an area where progress can be easily seen. After a few courses on 
     YouTube and the Scrimba platform, I was able to build this website from scratch as 
     a solo project of one of my module. I have made significant progress in just two months, and I know that I am doing what makes me happy. While I plan to master frontend development and get a job as a 
     front-end developer soon, I am not stopping there. 
     There are so many exciting things to learn and explore in the world of tech.
</p>

<h1 class="planheading" >My Coding Goals</h1>

<p class="myplans" >
    I'm not going to stop at front-end web development, though. After I master it, I plan to learn
     back-end development and explore the world of Python programming.
     I'm also interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence
     and plan to delve into those areas as well. Learning is a lifelong journey, and I am excited to see 
     where my passion for programming will take me

              Narutofy is a project that showcases my expertise in CSS and responsive design. The website's layout is visually appealing and adapts 
              seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. Through effective design principles and layout techniques, I was able to create a website
